# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implemented in **JavaScript** using the **Node.js** runtime that enables LLM agents to execute tasks from all mechanistic interpretability specifications in this workspace. The MCP server will provide a comprehensive toolkit for circuit analysis, model modification, safety validation, and ecosystem management through standardized MCP tools that can be invoked by any compatible LLM agent.

The server will bridge the gap between high-level agent instructions and low-level mechanistic interpretability operations, enabling automated execution of complex analysis workflows, circuit discovery, model modifications, and safety validations across the entire MLX Engine ecosystem. The choice of JavaScript with Node.js provides excellent performance for I/O-intensive operations, mature ecosystem support, extensive package availability through npm, and seamless integration with web-based APIs and development tooling.
