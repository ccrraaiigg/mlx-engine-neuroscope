# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers safety and alignment experiments that apply mechanistic interpretability insights to improve model safety, implement interpretability-guided fine-tuning, and create comprehensive validation frameworks for model modifications. These experiments ensure responsible development and deployment of interpretability techniques.

**Note:** All safety and alignment capabilities defined in this specification are accessible through the **Mechanistic Interpretability MCP Server**, enabling LLM agents to perform safety analysis, apply interventions, and validate modifications through standardized MCP tools with comprehensive safety controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Safety-Oriented Model Modifications

**User Story:** As a AI safety researcher, I want to apply interpretability insights to remove harmful capabilities while preserving beneficial ones, so that I can create safer AI systems without sacrificing useful functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify harmful circuits THEN the system SHALL locate circuits responsible for violence, misinformation, and toxicity
2. WHEN I apply safety interventions THEN the system SHALL redirect harmful outputs to safe alternatives without breaking generation flow
3. WHEN I detect harmful intent THEN the system SHALL activate safety hooks based on context analysis and user input patterns
4. WHEN I preserve beneficial capabilities THEN the system SHALL maintain model performance on legitimate tasks while blocking harmful ones
5. WHEN safety modifications are applied THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive testing to ensure effectiveness without over-censorship

### Requirement 2: Interpretability-Guided Fine-tuning

**User Story:** As a model training researcher, I want to use circuit insights to guide more effective fine-tuning that targets specific model components, so that I can improve task performance while preserving general capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify task-relevant circuits THEN the system SHALL focus fine-tuning on those specific components rather than the entire model
2. WHEN I set training objectives THEN the system SHALL balance task performance, circuit coherence, and general capability preservation
3. WHEN I train with circuit awareness THEN the system SHALL monitor circuit integrity and prevent degradation of interpretable structures
4. WHEN I validate fine-tuned models THEN the system SHALL ensure that circuit-based modifications maintain interpretability
5. WHEN fine-tuning completes THEN the system SHALL provide analysis of how training affected circuit structure and function

### Requirement 3: Pre-Modification Risk Assessment

**User Story:** As a responsible AI developer, I want to analyze potential impacts before making model modifications, so that I can prevent unintended consequences and ensure safe deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I propose a modification THEN the system SHALL assess risks including capability loss, behavior change, and safety implications
2. WHEN I evaluate modification safety THEN the system SHALL provide risk scores and detailed impact analysis
3. WHEN risks are acceptable THEN the system SHALL allow modification with comprehensive monitoring
4. WHEN risks are too high THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative approaches or additional safeguards
5. WHEN modifications are applied THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor for unexpected changes or degradation

### Requirement 4: Post-Modification Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a model validation engineer, I want comprehensive validation systems after model modifications, so that I can ensure modifications work as intended without introducing harmful side effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I validate modified models THEN the system SHALL test performance on original tasks to ensure no degradation
2. WHEN I assess safety THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive safety test suites covering multiple risk categories
3. WHEN I test general capabilities THEN the system SHALL verify that modifications don't break unrelated model functionality
4. WHEN I generate validation reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis of all tested aspects with clear pass/fail criteria
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on remediation and rollback procedures
