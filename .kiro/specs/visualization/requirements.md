# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates 3d-force-graph, a high-performance WebGL-based graph visualization library, into the MLX Engine with NeuroScope Integration project. The 3d-force-graph library will enable interactive 3D visualization of neural network circuits, attention patterns, activation flows, and model architecture graphs. This integration will enhance the mechanistic interpretability capabilities by providing intuitive visual representations of complex model internals with immersive 3D exploration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mechanistic interpretability researcher, I want to visualize neural network circuits as interactive 3D graphs, so that I can explore and understand the relationships between neurons and layers in an immersive environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN displaying circuit graphs THEN the system SHALL show nodes representing neurons/components and links representing connections in 3D space
3. WHEN a user interacts with circuit nodes THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the selected component with hover tooltips
4. IF circuit data contains activation strengths THEN the system SHALL visualize edge weights through line thickness, color intensity, and particle animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing attention patterns, I want to visualize attention heads and their connections as interactive 3D graphs, so that I can understand how different attention mechanisms interact across layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing attention patterns THEN the system SHALL create 3D graph visualizations showing attention head relationships with spatial layer separation
2. WHEN displaying attention graphs THEN the system SHALL use node size and color to represent attention strength in 3D space
3. WHEN a user hovers over attention nodes THEN the system SHALL show attention weights and target tokens with 3D tooltips
4. IF multiple attention layers exist THEN the system SHALL arrange layers in 3D space with camera controls for navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with NeuroScope, I want 3d-force-graph visualizations to be embedded in the web interface, so that users can access immersive 3D graph views alongside other analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NeuroScope web interface loads THEN the system SHALL include 3d-force-graph visualization components with WebGL rendering
2. WHEN activation data is captured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate corresponding 3D graph visualizations
3. WHEN users switch between different analysis views THEN the system SHALL maintain 3D graph state, camera position, and node positioning
4. IF the web interface updates THEN the system SHALL synchronize 3D graph data with the current model state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher working with large models, I want performant 3D graph rendering that can handle thousands of nodes, so that I can visualize complex model architectures without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering 3D graphs with 1000+ nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interaction performance using WebGL optimization
2. WHEN navigating large 3D graphs with camera controls THEN the system SHALL provide responsive visual feedback with 60fps rendering
3. WHEN loading 3D graph data THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading and instanced rendering for large datasets
4. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail rendering and node culling to maintain performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user analyzing model behavior, I want to export 3D graph visualizations in various formats, so that I can include them in research papers and presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests 3D graph export THEN the system SHALL support PNG screenshots, 3D model formats (GLB/GLTF), and JSON formats
2. WHEN exporting 3D graphs THEN the system SHALL maintain visual fidelity, camera position, and 3D layout positioning
3. WHEN exporting to JSON THEN the system SHALL include all node and link metadata plus 3D positioning data
4. IF custom 3D styling is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve visual customizations and materials in exports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer extending the visualization system, I want a clean API for creating custom 3D graph types, so that I can add domain-specific visualizations for different analysis needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating custom 3D visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin-style API for 3D graph types
2. WHEN registering new 3D graph types THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate them into the UI with 3D controls
3. WHEN custom 3D graphs are created THEN the system SHALL support standard 3d-force-graph configuration options and Three.js materials
4. IF 3D visualization plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle WebGL errors gracefully and provide 2D fallback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher comparing different models, I want to visualize multiple 3D graphs simultaneously, so that I can identify structural differences and similarities in 3D space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side 3D graph visualization with synchronized camera controls
2. WHEN displaying multiple 3D graphs THEN the system SHALL synchronize camera position, zoom, and rotation operations
3. WHEN highlighting nodes in one 3D graph THEN the system SHALL optionally highlight corresponding nodes in comparison graphs with 3D effects
4. IF 3D graph layouts differ THEN the system SHALL provide 3D alignment tools and overlay modes to facilitate comparison

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the chatbot interface, I want to request and view 3D graph visualizations through natural language commands, so that I can seamlessly integrate immersive visual analysis into my conversational workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests 3D graph visualization via chat THEN the MCP server SHALL generate appropriate 3d-force-graph visualizations
2. WHEN the chatbot processes visualization requests THEN the system SHALL support commands like "show 3D circuit graph for layer 12" or "visualize attention patterns in 3D"
3. WHEN 3D graphs are generated through MCP THEN the system SHALL embed interactive 3d-force-graph components in the chat interface
4. IF visualization parameters are specified in chat THEN the system SHALL apply custom 3D styling, filtering, camera positioning, and layout options
5. WHEN users ask follow-up questions about 3D graphs THEN the system SHALL maintain context and allow graph modifications through conversation
