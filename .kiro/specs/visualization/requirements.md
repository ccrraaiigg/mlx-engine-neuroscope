# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Cosmos Graph, a high-performance graph visualization library, into the MLX Engine with NeuroScope Integration project. Cosmos Graph will enable interactive visualization of neural network circuits, attention patterns, activation flows, and model architecture graphs. This integration will enhance the mechanistic interpretability capabilities by providing intuitive visual representations of complex model internals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mechanistic interpretability researcher, I want to visualize neural network circuits as interactive graphs, so that I can explore and understand the relationships between neurons and layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests circuit visualization THEN the system SHALL generate a graph representation using Cosmos Graph
2. WHEN displaying circuit graphs THEN the system SHALL show nodes representing neurons/components and edges representing connections
3. WHEN a user interacts with circuit nodes THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the selected component
4. IF circuit data contains activation strengths THEN the system SHALL visualize edge weights through line thickness or color intensity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing attention patterns, I want to visualize attention heads and their connections as interactive graphs, so that I can understand how different attention mechanisms interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing attention patterns THEN the system SHALL create graph visualizations showing attention head relationships
2. WHEN displaying attention graphs THEN the system SHALL use node size to represent attention strength
3. WHEN a user hovers over attention nodes THEN the system SHALL show attention weights and target tokens
4. IF multiple attention layers exist THEN the system SHALL provide layer-by-layer navigation controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with NeuroScope, I want Cosmos Graph visualizations to be embedded in the web interface, so that users can access graph views alongside other analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NeuroScope web interface loads THEN the system SHALL include Cosmos Graph visualization components
2. WHEN activation data is captured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate corresponding graph visualizations
3. WHEN users switch between different analysis views THEN the system SHALL maintain graph state and positioning
4. IF the web interface updates THEN the system SHALL synchronize graph data with the current model state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher working with large models, I want performant graph rendering that can handle thousands of nodes, so that I can visualize complex model architectures without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering graphs with 1000+ nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interaction performance
2. WHEN zooming or panning large graphs THEN the system SHALL provide responsive visual feedback
3. WHEN loading graph data THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading for large datasets
4. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail rendering to maintain performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user analyzing model behavior, I want to export graph visualizations in various formats, so that I can include them in research papers and presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests graph export THEN the system SHALL support PNG, SVG, and JSON formats
2. WHEN exporting graphs THEN the system SHALL maintain visual fidelity and layout positioning
3. WHEN exporting to JSON THEN the system SHALL include all node and edge metadata
4. IF custom styling is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve visual customizations in exports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer extending the visualization system, I want a clean API for creating custom graph types, so that I can add domain-specific visualizations for different analysis needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating custom visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin-style API for graph types
2. WHEN registering new graph types THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate them into the UI
3. WHEN custom graphs are created THEN the system SHALL support standard Cosmos Graph configuration options
4. IF visualization plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher comparing different models, I want to visualize multiple graphs simultaneously, so that I can identify structural differences and similarities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL support side-by-side graph visualization
2. WHEN displaying multiple graphs THEN the system SHALL synchronize zoom and pan operations
3. WHEN highlighting nodes in one graph THEN the system SHALL optionally highlight corresponding nodes in comparison graphs
4. IF graph layouts differ THEN the system SHALL provide alignment tools to facilitate comparison

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the chatbot interface, I want to request and view graph visualizations through natural language commands, so that I can seamlessly integrate visual analysis into my conversational workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests graph visualization via chat THEN the MCP server SHALL generate appropriate Cosmos Graph visualizations
2. WHEN the chatbot processes visualization requests THEN the system SHALL support commands like "show circuit graph for layer 12" or "visualize attention patterns"
3. WHEN graphs are generated through MCP THEN the system SHALL embed interactive Cosmos Graph components in the chat interface
4. IF visualization parameters are specified in chat THEN the system SHALL apply custom styling, filtering, and layout options
5. WHEN users ask follow-up questions about graphs THEN the system SHALL maintain context and allow graph modifications through conversation
