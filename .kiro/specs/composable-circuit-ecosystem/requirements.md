# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the development of a composable circuit ecosystem that enables building comprehensive libraries of discovered circuits, automated circuit discovery tools, sophisticated circuit composition frameworks, and quality assurance systems for circuit reliability and safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Circuit Library Development

**User Story:** As a circuit researcher, I want to build comprehensive libraries of discovered and validated circuits with proper metadata and organization, so that I can reuse circuits across different projects and share them with the research community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I discover a new circuit THEN the system SHALL store it with comprehensive metadata including functionality, validation results, and dependencies
2. WHEN I organize circuits THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical categorization (syntax, semantics, reasoning, etc.)
3. WHEN I search for circuits THEN the system SHALL provide semantic search capabilities based on functionality and characteristics
4. WHEN I version circuits THEN the system SHALL track changes, improvements, and compatibility across versions
5. WHEN I share circuits THEN the system SHALL support export/import with standardized formats and validation

### Requirement 2: Automated Circuit Discovery

**User Story:** As a scalable research developer, I want automated tools for discovering new circuits in existing models, so that I can systematically explore model capabilities without manual analysis of every component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a target capability THEN the system SHALL automatically generate hypotheses about potential implementing circuits
2. WHEN I run circuit discovery THEN the system SHALL use exhaustive search with intelligent pruning to find candidate circuits
3. WHEN I validate discovered circuits THEN the system SHALL automatically test hypotheses and measure circuit effectiveness
4. WHEN I extract validated circuits THEN the system SHALL provide interpretable descriptions and usage guidelines
5. WHEN discovery completes THEN the system SHALL rank circuits by confidence, effectiveness, and interpretability

### Requirement 3: Circuit Composition Framework

**User Story:** As a specialized AI system developer, I want to create sophisticated systems by combining multiple circuits into functional AI systems, so that I can build task-specific models from validated components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I compose circuits THEN the system SHALL resolve dependencies and ensure compatibility between components
2. WHEN I optimize composed systems THEN the system SHALL optimize data flow and minimize computational overhead
3. WHEN I validate compositions THEN the system SHALL test the integrated system for functionality and performance
4. WHEN I compile composed circuits THEN the system SHALL generate efficient implementations that can be deployed
5. WHEN composition conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide resolution strategies and alternative approaches

### Requirement 4: Quality Assurance and Validation

**User Story:** As a circuit reliability engineer, I want comprehensive testing systems to ensure circuit reliability, safety, and interpretability, so that I can deploy circuits with confidence in their behavior and safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I validate a circuit THEN the system SHALL test functionality across diverse inputs and edge cases
2. WHEN I benchmark performance THEN the system SHALL measure computational efficiency, accuracy, and resource usage
3. WHEN I assess interpretability THEN the system SHALL validate that circuit behavior matches its intended semantic description
4. WHEN I test safety THEN the system SHALL check for harmful outputs, bias, and unintended behaviors
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive quality reports with overall scores and recommendations
