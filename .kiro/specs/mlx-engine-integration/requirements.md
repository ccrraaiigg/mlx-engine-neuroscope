# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the integration experiments between MLX Engine and NeuroScope, focusing on REST API activation capture, comprehensive circuit analysis capabilities, and streaming activation analysis. These experiments validate the complete workflow from activation capture to interpretability analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: REST API Activation Capture

**User Story:** As a remote interpretability researcher, I want to capture neural activations during text generation via REST API, so that I can perform analysis from any environment that can make HTTP requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a generation request with activation hooks THEN the system SHALL capture activations from specified layers and components
2. WHEN I specify hook configurations THEN the system SHALL support all component types (residual, attention, mlp, embedding, etc.)
3. WHEN I receive API responses THEN the system SHALL include both generated text and captured activation data
4. WHEN I use streaming generation THEN the system SHALL provide real-time activation capture alongside text tokens
5. WHEN I convert activations for NeuroScope THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted data structures

### Requirement 2: Circuit Analysis via MLX Engine

**User Story:** As a comprehensive circuit analyst, I want to perform detailed circuit analysis using MLX Engine's activation hooks across different reasoning domains, so that I can understand how the model implements various cognitive capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze mathematical reasoning THEN the system SHALL capture activations during arithmetic computation and identify relevant circuits
2. WHEN I study factual recall THEN the system SHALL trace knowledge retrieval mechanisms and identify memory-like circuits
3. WHEN I examine creative writing THEN the system SHALL capture generative and creative circuits during story generation
4. WHEN I analyze attention patterns THEN the system SHALL provide multi-head attention analysis with interpretable visualizations
5. WHEN I track information flow THEN the system SHALL monitor residual stream changes across layers and identify information routing

### Requirement 3: Streaming Activation Analysis

**User Story:** As a real-time analysis researcher, I want to capture and analyze activations during streaming text generation, so that I can observe how model behavior evolves token by token during generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable streaming generation THEN the system SHALL capture activations for each generated token in real-time
2. WHEN I process streaming activations THEN the system SHALL provide immediate analysis results without waiting for complete generation
3. WHEN I monitor generation progress THEN the system SHALL show how activation patterns change as context grows
4. WHEN I detect interesting patterns THEN the system SHALL allow real-time intervention and steering
5. WHEN streaming completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive analysis of the complete generation sequence

### Requirement 4: NeuroScope Integration Validation

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want to validate that the complete MLX Engine to NeuroScope workflow functions correctly, so that researchers can seamlessly move from activation capture to sophisticated analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate Smalltalk interface code THEN the system SHALL create complete LMStudioRESTClient classes for NeuroScope
2. WHEN I convert activation data THEN the system SHALL transform MLX Engine formats to NeuroScope-compatible structures
3. WHEN I use NeuroScope analysis tools THEN the system SHALL provide proper data integration with circuit finders and visualizers
4. WHEN I perform end-to-end workflows THEN the system SHALL support the complete pipeline from model loading to circuit analysis
5. WHEN integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
