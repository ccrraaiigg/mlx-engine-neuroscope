# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers circuit analysis experiments that enable direct manipulation of transformer models through circuit-based weight editing, activation steering, knowledge injection, and capability transfer. These experiments represent interventions that modify model behavior while preserving core capabilities.

**Note:** All circuit analysis capabilities defined in this specification are accessible through the **Mechanistic Interpretability MCP Server**, enabling LLM agents to perform complex model modifications through standardized MCP tools with built-in safety validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Circuit-Based Weight Editing

**User Story:** As a model modification researcher, I want to directly modify weights that implement specific computational circuits, so that I can make precise changes to model behavior without affecting unrelated capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify a specific circuit (e.g., gender bias in pronoun resolution) THEN the system SHALL extract the exact weights implementing that circuit
2. WHEN I apply weight modifications to a circuit THEN the system SHALL preserve other model capabilities while changing the target behavior
3. WHEN I create debiasing transformations THEN the system SHALL remove unwanted biases while maintaining task performance
4. WHEN I modify circuit weights THEN the system SHALL validate changes through comprehensive testing
5. IF weight modifications cause capability degradation THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms and alternative approaches

### Requirement 2: Activation Steering and Control

**User Story:** As a model control researcher, I want to use insights about activation patterns to steer model behavior without changing weights, so that I can dynamically control model outputs based on context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify neurons responsible for specific behaviors THEN the system SHALL create activation hooks that can modify those neurons in real-time
2. WHEN I apply activation steering THEN the system SHALL support conditional steering based on context (e.g., task type, content category)
3. WHEN I create persistent activation hooks THEN the system SHALL maintain steering effects across multiple generations
4. WHEN I modify activation patterns THEN the system SHALL preserve text coherence and quality
5. WHEN I apply multiple steering interventions THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts and prioritization appropriately

### Requirement 3: Knowledge Injection and Editing

**User Story:** As a knowledge management researcher, I want to modify specific factual knowledge in models while preserving general capabilities, so that I can update model knowledge without full retraining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify factual knowledge circuits THEN the system SHALL locate the specific layers and components storing that information
2. WHEN I update factual knowledge THEN the system SHALL modify the relevant circuits while preserving related knowledge
3. WHEN I inject new knowledge THEN the system SHALL integrate it coherently with existing knowledge structures
4. WHEN I edit knowledge THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across related facts and concepts
5. IF knowledge editing conflicts with existing information THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Capability Transfer and Enhancement

**User Story:** As a model capability researcher, I want to transfer discovered circuits between models or enhance existing capabilities, so that I can improve model performance in specific domains without full retraining.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify valuable circuits in one model THEN the system SHALL extract them in a transferable format
2. WHEN I transfer circuits between models THEN the system SHALL adapt them to different architectures and layer configurations
3. WHEN I install transferred circuits THEN the system SHALL integrate them without disrupting existing model functionality
4. WHEN I enhance capabilities THEN the system SHALL measure improvement in target tasks while monitoring for negative side effects
5. WHEN circuit transfer fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and alternative approaches
