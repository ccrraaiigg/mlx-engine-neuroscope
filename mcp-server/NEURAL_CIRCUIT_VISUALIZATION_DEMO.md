# Neural Circuit Visualization Demo Guide

This guide documents how to create real-time, interactive visualizations of neural circuits from GPT-OSS-20B using the mechanistic interpretability MCP server.

## Critical Development Workflow

### Code Modification Protocol

**MANDATORY**: Every time you modify MCP server code (`mcp-server/src/filesystem_pattern_server.js`):

1. **Increment Version Number**: Update the version in the `versionTool` function
   ```javascript
   version: 25, // Increment from previous number
   changes: "Description of what was changed"
   ```

2. **Ask User to Reload**: Always request user to reload the MCP server in Cursor
   ```
   "Please reload the mcp-server in Cursor"
   ```

3. **Verify Reload**: First tool call after reload MUST be `version` to confirm changes
   ```
   mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_version
   ```

4. **Confirm Success**: Check that the returned version matches your increment
   - ✅ Version matches → Changes applied successfully
   - ❌ Version doesn't match → Server not reloaded, ask user to reload again

### Example Development Cycle
```
1. Modify code → version: 24 → version: 25
2. "Please reload the mcp-server in Cursor"
3. Call version tool → Expect: {"version": 25}
4. If version ≠ 25 → "Please reload again"
5. If version = 25 → Continue with testing
```

**Why This Matters**: The version number is the only reliable way to confirm that code changes have been loaded by the MCP server. Without this verification, you may be testing old code and debugging non-existent issues.

## Overview

We have successfully built a complete end-to-end pipeline that:
1. **Discovers neural circuits** automatically using real activation capture and causal analysis
2. **Localizes specific features** across multiple transformer layers using activation comparison
3. **Captures real activation data** from GPT-OSS-20B during inference
4. **Converts raw activations** to interactive graph format (nodes and links)
5. **Renders beautiful WebGL2 visualizations** using 3D Force Graph
6. **Provides interactive exploration** with node hovering and real-time updates

## System Architecture

```
GPT-OSS-20B Model → MLX Engine → MCP Server → 3D Force Graph WebGL2 → Browser
     (Inference)    (Capture)   (Convert)      (Visualize)        (Interact)
```

## Key Components

- Hardware-accelerated interactive visualizations
- Node hovering, clicking, and real-time updates

## Demo Instructions

**Important**: This demo is driven by **conversation with the user**. The agent should respond to user requests by invoking the appropriate MCP tools. The following steps represent a typical demo flow, but the agent should adapt based on user questions and interests.

### Prerequisites
- GPT-OSS-20B model loaded and running on MLX Engine (port 50111)
- MCP server connected to Cursor
- Visualization server running on port 8888

### Typical Demo Flow

When a user asks to see the neural circuit visualization demo, the agent should:

1. **Verify system status** by checking MCP server version and service health
2. **Load model** if not already loaded using the real model loading tool
3. **Discover circuits** automatically for specific phenomena (arithmetic, factual recall, etc.)
4. **Localize features** across transformer layers using activation comparison
5. **Capture fresh activation data** from GPT-OSS-20B for specific prompts
6. **Create interactive visualization** from the captured data
7. **Open browser** to display the WebGL2 visualization
8. **Explain the results** and answer user questions about neural circuits discovered

### Step 1: Verify System Status (Agent Action)

The agent should first check system status when requested:

#### Check MCP Server Version
```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_version
```
Expected: Version 107+ with clean responses (no JSON errors)

**Important**: The version number indicates the server state and must be incremented every time the MCP server code is modified.

#### Check All Services Health  
```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_health_check
service: "all"
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "overall_status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "mlx_engine": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "component": "MLX Engine REST API",
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "current_model": "gpt-oss-20b",
      "ready": true
    },
    "visualization_server": {
      "status": "healthy", 
      "component": "Visualization Web Server",
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "port": 8888,
      "ready": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Start Services (if needed)
If any service is unreachable, the agent should start it:

**Start MLX Engine:**
```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_start_server
service: "mlx"
```

**Start Visualization Server:**
```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_start_server  
service: "visualization"
```

### Step 2: Load Model (Agent Action)

**CRITICAL: Always reload the model for clean analysis!**

Even if a model is already loaded, the agent should reload it to ensure clean state:

**Why reload?** Previous analyses may have influenced the model's internal state (attention patterns, residual stream, activation baselines). For accurate mechanistic interpretability research, each visualization should analyze the model's **natural processing** of each math problem, not processing after being "primed" with previous mathematical operations.

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_load_model
model_id: "gpt-oss-20b"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "model_id": "gpt-oss-20b", 
  "status": "loaded",
  "model_info": {
    "supports_activations": true,
    "architecture": "transformer",
    "num_layers": 20
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Discover Neural Circuits (Agent Action)

The agent can now discover real neural circuits for specific phenomena:

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_discover_circuits
phenomenon: "arithmetic"  # or "factual_recall", "IOI", etc.
model_id: "gpt-oss-20b" 
max_circuits: 5
```

**Real Results Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "phenomenon": "arithmetic",
  "prompt_used": "What is 15 + 27? The answer is",
  "generated_text": "42",
  "circuits_discovered": 6,
  "circuits": [
    {
      "circuit_id": "arithmetic_model.layers.0.self_attn_attention",
      "layer_name": "model.layers.0.self_attn", 
      "component": "attention",
      "activation_count": 14,
      "confidence": 0.7
    }
  ],
  "total_activations_captured": 126,
  "analysis_method": "real_activation_capture_with_mlx_engine"
}
```

### Step 4: Localize Features (Agent Action)

The agent can localize specific features across transformer layers:

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_localize_features
feature_name: "arithmetic"  # or "sentiment", "syntax", etc.
model_id: "gpt-oss-20b"
layer_range: {"start": 0, "end": 15}
```

**Real Results**: Compares activations across multiple layers to identify where specific features are processed.

### Step 5: Capture Fresh Activation Data (Agent Action)

**IMPORTANT: Use ONE consistent math problem per visualization!**

The agent should choose a specific math problem and use it consistently for both circuit discovery and activation capture within the same visualization demo:

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_capture_activations
prompt: "What is 84 ÷ 12?"  # Use SAME operation type as circuit discovery
max_tokens: 50
temperature: 0.1
```

**Best Practice Guidelines:**
- **Per Demo**: Use one math problem for all tool calls (circuit discovery + activation capture + visualization)
- **Between Demos**: Use different math problems for separate visualization sessions
- **Consistency**: Ensure circuit discovery and activation capture analyze the same mathematical operation

**User Interaction**: The agent can ask the user: *"What math problem would you like to see the neural circuits for? For example, multiplication like '7×8', addition like '15+27', or division like '84÷12'?"*

This captures real neural activations from:
- `model.layers.0.mlp.mlp` (red nodes - Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- `model.layers.0.self_attn.attention` (blue nodes - Attention mechanism)
- `model.layers.5.self_attn.attention` (blue nodes - Higher-layer attention)

Each activation contains:
- `component`: "mlp" or "attention" 
- `layer_name`: e.g., "model.layers.0.mlp"
- `shape`: Tensor dimensions [1, 32, 768]
- `dtype`: "float32"

### Step 6: Create Interactive Visualization (Agent Action)

The agent automatically uses the captured data to create the visualization:

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_circuit_diagram
circuit_data: {raw activation data from step 2}
circuit_name: "GPT-OSS-20B [Problem Type] Circuit ([specific problem])"
```

This automatically:
- Converts raw activations to nodes and links
- Generates WebGL2-ready graph data
- Creates interactive HTML visualization
- Saves files to `mcp-server/src/visualization/`

### Step 7: Open Browser Visualization (Agent Action)

The agent opens the visualization in the user's browser:

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_open_browser
url: "http://localhost:8888/real_circuit.html"
```

**User Interaction**: The agent should explain: *"I've opened the interactive visualization in your browser. You can hover over the nodes to see layer details and explore how the neural network processes the math problem."*

## Expected Results

### What the User Will See

The agent should explain what's happening as the demo progresses and help the user understand the visualization.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **JSON Parsing Errors**: Fixed in v22+ by removing console.log from tool responses
2. **Variable Scoping**: Fixed in v24 by using `rawCircuitData` consistently  
3. **Empty Visualizations**: Ensure data conversion detects `model.layers.*` keys
4. **Browser Errors**: Check that 3D Force Graph renderer is properly imported

### Verification Steps

1. **Check MCP Server**: `mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_version` → Should be 107+
2. **Check All Services**: `mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_health_check` → All should be healthy  
3. **Manual MLX Engine**: `curl http://localhost:50111/health` → Should return JSON with version
4. **Manual Visualization**: `curl http://localhost:8888/health` → Should return JSON with version
5. **Test Data Capture**: Activation arrays should contain multiple tensors
6. **Browser Console**: Should show successful 3D Force Graph initialization

### Health Check Tools

#### Check Individual Services
```bash
# Check only MLX Engine
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_health_check service: "mlx"

# Check only Visualization Server  
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_health_check service: "visualization"

# Check all services (default)
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_health_check service: "all"
```

#### Start Servers Automatically
```bash
# Start MLX Engine if not running
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_start_server service: "mlx"

# Start Visualization Server if not running
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_start_server service: "visualization" 

# Force restart (even if already running)

## Critical Best Practices for Clean Analysis

### Model State Management

**Always reload the model between visualization demos:**

```
mcp_mechanistic-interpretability_load_model
model_id: "gpt-oss-20b"
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Clean slate**: Each analysis starts with pristine model state
- **No contamination**: Previous mathematical operations don't influence current analysis
- **Research accuracy**: Captures natural processing, not primed responses
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent baseline for each demonstration

**The `load_model` tool behavior:**
- **Overwrites** existing model instance with fresh load
- **Resets** internal state (attention patterns, residual stream, KV cache)
- **Ensures** authentic neural circuit analysis

### Math Problem Consistency  

**One problem per complete demo:**
- Circuit discovery: Use one mathematical operation
- Activation capture: Use the SAME mathematical operation  
- Visualization: Shows unified analysis of one problem

**Different problems between demos:**
- Demo 1: "7 × 8 = 56" (multiplication analysis)
- Demo 2: "84 ÷ 12 = 7" (division analysis)  
- Demo 3: "15 + 27 = 42" (addition analysis)
