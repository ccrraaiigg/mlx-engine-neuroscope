## On Testing ##

Something untested is never successful. You cannot declare success without testing it first.

## Workflow: Never Fake Anything. Otherwise, Proceed Without Asking.

Never fake anything. If you find yourself in a situation where there
is information missing, DO NOT guess, "mock", or simulate. Instead,
STOP and ask the user for clarification. Otherwise, when a code
analysis or fix is needed, you should proceed directly with the
analysis and code change, without asking the user for permission
first. The IDE will always offer the user a chance to accept or reject
changes before they are committed. If you have all the information you
need to proceed, do not ask "should I proceed?"... just do the work.

## Creating and Modifying Specifications

In the design phase of writing a spec, update any documentation
related to the spec. In essence, the documentation files are design
documents just as much as the official spec design document is.

## Documenting Development Progress

After each successful feature addition, ensure that
IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md is up to date.

## Using the MLX Python API

The documentation is at https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx

## Using the shell

The shell is 'zsh', not 'bash'. Always wait for commands to
finish. You are not allowed to run any code from the shell. The only
way you are allowed to run code is via the MCP server tools.

## Using TypeScript

Never use TypeScript; use vanilla JavaScript.

## Using Smalltalk

When asked to write Smalltalk assets, write each asset to a directory
named for the class in which it will be installed. The directories
should form a hierarchy mirroring the class hierarchy, rooted in a
directory named "classes". Write each class comment in a file named
"COMMENT.md". Write each method in a file named for the selector that
method will use. The content of a method file should use Smalltalk
syntax. When writing a new method, writing a comment but no code is
acceptable. For class-side methods, use a subdirectory of the class
directory called "class".

## Using JavaScript

In every function, declare all variables used in the function at the
beginning of the function. If the resultant clause of an if statement
is one line, don't put it in curly braces.

Never bundle sources. Never use webpack or anything like it.

## Using the mcp-server MCP Server

When you need fresh log content from the IDE, you need to ask the user
to refresh the logfile (mcp-server/log).

## When generating HTML

Don't declare success until the user has given feedback on the
result. There's an MCP tool for opening a browser. HTML files are
generated by the MCP server tools. You shouldn't be editing HTML files
directly.

## WASM Tools

The only WASM tools you may use are 'wasm-tools' and 'wasm-opt'. You
may not use wat2wasm or any other WASM tools.
