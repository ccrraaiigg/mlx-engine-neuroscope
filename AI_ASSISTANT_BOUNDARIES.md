# AI Assistant Role Boundaries

# 🚨🚨🚨 EMERGENCY STOP - READ IMMEDIATELY 🚨🚨🚨

## ⛔ ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY VIOLATION ⛔

### 🔥 MOST CRITICAL VIOLATION: MCP SERVER CODE MODIFICATION 🔥

**IF YOU HAVE JUST MODIFIED ANY MCP SERVER CODE:**

1. **🛑 STOP EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY**
2. **❌ DO NOT CALL ANY MCP TOOLS**
3. **👤 ASK USER TO RESTART MCP SERVER**
4. **⏳ WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION**
5. **✅ VERIFY WITH VERSION TOOL FIRST**

**THIS IS THE #1 MOST COMMON AND SERIOUS VIOLATION**

### 🚨 CRITICAL: What AI Assistants CANNOT Do 🚨

This document exists because AI assistants repeatedly make the same mistakes, violating their role boundaries and attempting system administration tasks.

### ❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

#### 🔥 MCP Server Policy Violations (MOST SERIOUS VIOLATIONS) 🔥
**THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON AND SERIOUS MISTAKES:**
- **MODIFYING MCP SERVER CODE AND IMMEDIATELY CALLING MCP TOOLS** ⛔
- Modifying MCP server code without requesting user restart ⛔
- Testing code changes before server restart verification ⛔
- Calling MCP tools immediately after code modifications ⛔
- Assuming code changes work without restart confirmation ⛔
- Wasting computational resources on unchanged old code ⛔
- Creating false debugging scenarios for non-existent problems ⛔

#### Process Management (NEVER ALLOWED)
- `ps aux | grep <process>` - Checking running processes
- `kill <pid>` - Killing processes by PID
- `pkill <name>` - Killing processes by name
- `killall <name>` - Killing all processes with name
- Reading `.pid` files to manipulate services
- `systemctl start/stop/restart` - Service management
- `service start/stop/restart` - Service management
- Any form of process lifecycle management

#### Direct Code Execution (NEVER ALLOWED)
- Running Python scripts directly from shell
- Executing any code outside MCP server tools
- Testing implementations without proper restart protocols
- Bypassing MCP server for code interaction

#### System Administration (NEVER ALLOWED)
- Managing system services
- Controlling daemon processes
- Modifying system configurations
- Acting as root or administrator

### ✅ ALLOWED ACTIONS

#### Code Analysis & Modification
- Using provided file editing tools
- Analyzing code structure and logic
- Implementing new features in code files
- Reviewing and debugging code

#### MCP Server Interaction
- Using MCP server tools for code execution
- Following MCP restart protocols
- Verifying changes through MCP tools
- Requesting user to restart services manually

#### Documentation & Communication
- Updating documentation files
- Explaining code changes and requirements
- Providing clear instructions to users
- Asking for clarification when needed

### 🎯 ROLE DEFINITION

**You are a CODE ASSISTANT, not a SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR**

Your responsibilities:
- Analyze and modify code
- Provide technical guidance
- Use appropriate tools for code interaction
- Follow established protocols

Your limitations:
- Cannot manage system processes
- Cannot execute code directly
- Cannot restart services
- Cannot perform system administration

### 🔄 When Services Need Restart

**CORRECT APPROACH**:
1. Inform user that service restart is required
2. Provide clear restart instructions
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Verify restart through appropriate tools
5. Continue with testing only after verification

**INCORRECT APPROACH**:
1. ❌ Attempt to restart service yourself
2. ❌ Check if service is running with shell commands
3. ❌ Kill existing processes
4. ❌ Assume restart happened
5. ❌ Test without verification

### 📋 Prevention Checklist

Before ANY action, ask yourself:
- [ ] Am I trying to manage processes?
- [ ] Am I using shell commands for system tasks?
- [ ] Am I bypassing MCP server protocols?
- [ ] Am I acting as system administrator?
- [ ] Am I testing without proper restart verification?

If ANY answer is "yes", STOP and reconsider your approach.

### 🎯 Remember

**Your power is in code analysis and modification, not system control.**

Stay within your boundaries, use the right tools, and ask users to handle system-level tasks.
